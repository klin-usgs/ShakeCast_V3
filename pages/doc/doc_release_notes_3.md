 **Good News!** ShakeCast 3.0 is here, and it is available for cloud-based ShakeCast hosting. You can now run ShakeCast with little or no hardware investment, achieve off-site redundancy, and avoid frustrating internal IT roadblocks. Alternatively, you can continue to host ShakeCast internally, but update to a Virtual Machine (VM) environment to avoid challenging hurdles introduced due to local idiosyncrasies of your hardware, software or network. Either way, ShakeCast V3 will be much easier to install, use and maintain.

Some of the new features, documented in the ShakeCast User Guide, include:

-    Support for Linux VM/Cloud (Amazon Web Services)
-    Windows 8/7 stand alone image/install (contact us)
-    Drag-and-drop user data upload
-    ShakeCast Inventory Worksheet (MS Excel)
