=head1 NAME

Setup - ShakeCast configuration instructions

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a random collection of notes intended to help anyone trying to bring
up a new ShakeCast server.

=head2 OVERVIEW

=head2 Directories

There is one directory hierarchy for all of ShakeCast except the product files;
this is sometimes called the I<ShakeCast root>.
Relative file paths are usually taken relative to this location.
By default this is configured to be F<C:/sc>.
If you want to change this location you will need to look through the
configuration file F<conf/sc.conf> and make the necessary changes.

The product files reside in a separate hierarchy to simplify space management
issues (the total volume of product files could be quite large).
The default location as defined in F<conf/sc.conf> is F<C:/sc_data>.

=head2 Configuration files

The config files (mostly?) are found in F<conf/>.
The primary configuration file is typically named F<sc.conf>.  The exception
to this naming convention is that it can also have a name that matches the first
part (up to the first dot) of the site's hostname.

=head2 Installing the daemons

ShakeCast uses several daemons to handle various parts of the processing.
These need to be installed as Windows services.

=over 4

=item dispd

The dispatch daemon takes locally generated requests for remote files,
queues those requests, then returns to the caller.  The requests are serviced
later by child processes.
To install the dispatch daemon you should first check the configuration
information located in the I<Dispatcher> section of the main configuration
file (C<conf/sc.conf>, unless you have renamed it).
If you chose a non-standard location for the root directory then you will
probably want to modify the C<LOG> parameter.
All the other values can probably be left alone.

To install dispd:

  $ dispd.pl --install

Note that this does not start the daemon, it only installs it.
You can uninstall the daemon as well:

  $ dispd.pl --remove

Also see L<bin/dispd.pl> for details about this daemon.

=item polld

The polling daemon is responsible for periodically checking with other servers
that have been configured as source systems to see if new data is available
for download.
This daemon is configured and installed similarly to the dispatch daemon.
Also see L<bin/polld.pl> for details about this daemon.

=item notifyqueue

The Notification Generator looks for new events, shakemaps, or products
to be delivered to the server.  When that happens it checks to see if any
ShakeCast users want to be notified of same, and if so, adds a notification
to the Notification Queue (which will later be processed and sent by the
Notification Distribution daemon).
This daemon is configured and installed similarly to the dispatch daemon,
using settings in the I<Notifyqueue> section of the configuration file.

=item notify

The Notification Distributor takes notifications from the notification
queue (in the database) and sends each to its recipient.
This daemon is configured and installed similarly to the dispatch daemon,
using settings in the I<Notify> section of the configuration file.
