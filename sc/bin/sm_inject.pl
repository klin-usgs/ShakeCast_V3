=head1 NAME

sm_inject - inject new event, shakemap, or product into ShakeCast

=head1 SYNOPSIS

sm_inject [B<--verbose>] [B<--conf=>I<config-file>] [I<event-xml-file>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This program is used to inject a new event, shakemap, or product
into the ShakeCast system.
It is primarily intended for use by the Shakemap server after an event
has been generated, but can also be used to inject test events locally.

The event, shakemap, or product is specified in an XML format file whose
name is passed as a
command line argument to C<sm_inject>, or the XML can be fed to
the program via C<stdin>.


=head2 Invocation Options

=over 4

=item B<--verbose>

This option causes B<sm_inject> to write progress messages to C<stdout>.

=item --conf=config-file

B<--conf> can be used to specifiy an alternate configuration file.
If an absolute path is not given then it is searched for in
I<Shakecast-root>B</conf/>.

=back

=head1 CONFIGURATION

The configuration file specifies where the data is to be delivered.
By default the configuration fiie I<Shakecast-root>B</conf/sc.conf>
is used.
You can override this setting using the C<--conf> command line option.

B<NOTE:> The configuration file contains unencrypted passwords.
It is important to secure this file from malicious users by making
it readable only by the account that executes B<sm_inject>.

=head2 Configuration File directives

=over 4

=item LogDir I<directory>

This directive specifies the absolute path of the directory where the log
file will be written.

=item LogFile I<filename>

This directive specifies the name of the log file relative to C<LogDir>.
The file name can include patterns that represent the current year,
month, and day:

    %Y      four-digit year
    %y      last two digits of year
    %m      month (00 - 12)
    %d      day   (00 - 31)
    %%      a single %

=item LogLevel I<n>

This directive controls how much logging information is produced.
Level 0 is the least (errors only).  Larger numbers (up to 9) produce
more information.

=item LocalServerId I<n>

Specify the Server ID for the source system.  This Server must be known
to the destination ShakeCast servers and must be configured in each of
them as an Upstream server. 

=item Destination

Each <Destination> block defines one recipient of Shakecast data.  The
directive can be repeated if you want to distribute Shakecast data to more
than one server.
The destination block contains two required directives, C<Hostname> and
C<Password>.
C<Hostname> is either a FQDN or the IP address of the downstream server.
C<Password> is the cleartext password that will be used to
authenticate the connection.
The destination server must have been configured to accept connections
from this server with the given password (the "Incoming Password").

=back

=head2 Sample configuration file

    LogDir             /usr/local/sc/logs
    LogFile            sc%y%m.log
    LogLevel           1
    
    LocalServerId       98
    
    <Destination>
        Hostname    test.shakecast.org
        Password    secret
    </Destination>


=head2 Local testing

You can use B<sm_inject> to test your local Shakecast setup.
Pick a number to use as the ServerId of the data injector and set
the LocalServerId value in your configuration file.
Define a new Server with this Id in the Shakecast Administration application.
Set the server to be "Upstream" and enter an Incoming Password.
Then add a <Destination> block that has the hostname or IP address
of the server you want to test; the Destination Password is set to the
value of the Incoming password.

=head1 EXAMPLES

To load the new event specified by the file B<evt13935988.xml> using
the default configuration:

 $ sm_inject.pl evt13935988.xml

To use the configuration file B<sms.conf> and supply the
XML event definition as a shell I<here document>:

 $ sm_inject.pl --conf sms.conf <<EOF
 <event
     event_id="13935988"
     event_version="2"
     event_status="NORMAL"
     event_type="ACTUAL"
     event_name="13935988"
     event_location_description="3.1 mi N of Big Bear City, CA"
     event_timestamp="2003-02-25 17:11:12"
     external_event_id="ci3935988"
     magnitude="5.4"
     lat="34.31"
     lon="-116.85"
 />
 EOF

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

The script exits with 0 (success) if the event was delivered successfully
to all downstream servers, otherwise with a non-zero value.  Each failed
event delivery is recorded to C<stderr> as:

[I<downstream-hostname>] I<failure-code> I<error-message>

where I<failure-code> is typically B<HTTP_FAIL> for some error in the
transport layer (ex: server not reachable) or B<FAILED> for an error
processing the event message at the remote server (ex: badly formed XML).
Keep in mind that often these messages reflect a failure at the remote
server.

=head2 Examples

This error was produced when the C<event_id> attribute was omitted from
the event XML:

C<< [sc1.shakecast.com] FAILED: DBD::Oracle::db do failed: ORA-01400: cannot insert NULL into ("SC1"."EVENT"."EVENT_ID") (DBD: oexec error) at d:/sc/lib/SC/Event.pm line 160,<STDIN> line 1. >>
