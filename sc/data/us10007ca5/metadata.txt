    Description:
      Abstract:
        ShakeMap is designed as a rapid response tool to portray the 
        extent and variation of ground shaking throughout the affected 
        region immediately following significant earthquakes. Ground 
        motion and intensity maps are derived from peak ground motion
        amplitudes recorded on seismic sensors (accelerometers), with 
        interpolation based on both estimated amplitudes where data are 
        lacking, and site amplification corrections.  Color-coded 
        instrumental intensity maps are derived from empirical relations 
        between peak ground motions and Modified Mercalli intensity. 
        This ShakeMap describes the event: us10007ca5, 
        SOUTHERN XINJIANG, CHINA
      Purpose:
        As a rapid response tool, the ShakeMap ground motion values are 
        used for emergency response, loss estimation, assessment of damage 
        to the lifeline and utility networks, and for providing information 
        to the general public.

  Data_Quality_Information:
    Attribute_Accuracy:
      Attribute_Accuracy_Report:
        Slight variations in peak ground motions and spectral values 
        may depend on processing. Corrections or changes in station 
        and amplitude information are reflected by the authoritative 
        seismic network. In addition, changes in magnitude may result 
        in changes to estimated ground motions in areas with sparse 
        seismic station coverage.

    Completeness_Report:
      Included in this version are data available up to the time processed.
      Additional data (seismic stations) may be added at a later time.
    Logical_Consistency_Report:
      Ground motion data are direct measurements only at the location
      of seismic stations; all other data are interpolated (as
      described in the citations).  Seismic station coverage varies 
      in density as well as instrumentation across the region in 
      question.  Uncertainty in the reported ground motions generally
      increases with distance from seismic stations, and in areas of 
      very low station density may be largely the product of empirical 
      relationships.  Uncertainties in ground motions may also arise
      from inaccurate ground motion amplitudes from seismic stations, 
      or inaccurate information regarding earthquake epicenter or 
      magnitude, as reported by the generating network.

      Process_Step: 
        Process_Description:
          Shaking maps are prepared by contouring shaking information 
          interpolated onto a square grid uniformly sampled at a 
          spacing of 1 minute (about 1.6 km) throughout California. If 
          there were stations at each of the tens of thousands of grid 
          points, then the creation of shaking maps would be relatively 
          simple. Of course stations are not available for all of these 
          grid points, and in many cases grid points may be tens of 
          kilometers from the nearest reporting station. The overall 
          mapping philosophy is to combine information from individual 
          stations, geology (representing site amplification), and the 
          distance to the epicenter or causative fault to create the 
          best composite map. The procedure produces reasonable estimates 
          at grid points located far from available data, while 
          preserving the detailed shaking information available for 
          regions where there are stations nearby.

          Estimation of shaking over the regional extent for an earthquake 
          in California is obtained by the spatial interpolation of the 
          measured ground motions with geologically based frequency and 
          amplitude-dependent site corrections. We use the California 
          Site Condition Map (California Geological Survey, CGS) maps 
          of National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program (NEHRP) 
          classification site conditions as the basis for our site 
          corrections. These site condition maps have coverage throughout 
          the state at 1:250,000 scale (Wills et al., 2000). We use the 
          amplification factors of Borcherdt et al. (1994). In addition, 
          ShakeMap ground motions in regions of sparse station spacing 
          are estimated using ground motion regression, initially from 
          a point location at the epicenter. Later, as information about 
          fault dimensions became available (in the form of aftershocks, 
          source rupture models, and observed surface slip), the fault 
          location and rupture dimensions are used as the basis for 
          ground motion estimation.

          First, peak ground motion parameters are recovered for each 
          station and associated with a particular earthquake origin time 
          and epicenter. We then create a coarse, uniformly spaced grid 
          of 30-km spaced "phantom" stations. Peak ground motions and 
          spectral acceleration values are assigned to each coarse grid 
          point using a ground motion attenuation relationship for 
          rock sites given the magnitude of the earthquake and distance 
          to each grid point.  In practice, we apply a static correction 
          to the amplitudes of the regression by using the network-determined 
          magnitude, predicting the observed amplitudes, and correcting for 
          an amplitude bias term between the predictions and the data. 
          
           
          Site corrections are then used to interpolate from ground 
          motions recorded on a fairly sparse, non-uniformly spaced 
          network of stations to maps showing spatially continuous 
          functions (i.e., contours).  Prior to interpolation, we reduce 
          the ground motion amplitudes to a common reference, in this 
          case bedrock motions. Peak ground motion amplitudes from the 
          seismic stations are corrected to rock site conditions; and 
          the observations (corrected to rock) and the coarse phantom 
          stations (computed for rock) are then interpolated to a fine 
          rock site grid (roughly 1.6-km spacing). We scale the peak 
          acceleration (PGA) amplitude with the Borcherdt et al. (1994) 
          short-period amplification factors while the peak ground 
          velocity (PGV) values are corrected with the mid-period 
          factors. Response spectral values are scaled by the short-period 
          factors at 0.3 sec, and by the mid-period response at 1.0 and 
          3.0 seconds. The site correction procedure is applied so that 
          the original data values are returned at each station; hence, 
          the actual recorded motions are preserved in the process and 
          the final contours reflect the observations wherever they exist.

          Next, the interpolated rock grid is corrected at each point
          for local site amplification and instrumental intensity map is 
          generated by relating the peak ground acceleration or velocity 
          at each grid point to intensity as described by Wald et al. (1999). 
          This fine grid is saved and exported to the file "grid.xyz". A 
          continuous surface is also fit to the fine grid to produce 
          the contour maps and GIS formatted maps.

    Resource_Description: Shakemap data for us10007ca5
    Distribution_Liability:
      Some USGS information accessed through this page may be preliminary in
      nature and presented prior to final review and approval by the
      Director of the USGS. This information is provided with the
      understanding that it is not guaranteed to be correct or complete, and
      conclusions drawn from such information are the sole responsibility of
      the user. 
  
      These are automatic computer generated maps and have not necessarily
      been checked by human oversight, so they may contain errors. Further,
      the input data is raw and unchecked, and may contain errors.
  
      Contours can be misleading since data gaps may exist. Caution should
      be used in deciding which features in the contour patterns are
      required by the data. Ground motions and intensities can vary greatly
      over small distances, so these maps are only approximate; when maps
      are enlarged beyond the limits of the original data in an effort to
      show small areas, the maps are unreliable.
  
      These maps are preliminary in nature and will be updated as data
      arrives from distributed sources. 
  
      The estimated intensity map is derived from ground motions recorded by
      seismographs and represents Modified Mercalli Intensities (MMI's) that
      are likely to have been associated with the ground motions. Unlike
      conventional Modified Mercalli Intensities, the estimated intensities
      are not based on observations of the earthquake effects on people or
      structures.
  
      Locations within the same intensity area will not necessarily
      experience the same level of damage since damage depends heavily on
      the type of structure, the nature of the construction, and the details
      of the ground motion at that site. For this reason more or less damage
      than described in the MMI scale may occur.
  
      Large earthquakes can generate very long-period ground motions that
      can cause damage at great distances from the epicenter; although the
      intensity estimated from the ground motions may be small, significant
      effects to large structures (bridges, tall buildings, storage tanks)
      may be notable.
  
      The ground motion levels and descriptions associated with each
      intensity value are based on recent damaging earthquakes. There may be
      revisions in these parameters as more data become available or from
      further improvements in methodology.
