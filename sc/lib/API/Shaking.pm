=item SC::Event->from_xml('d:/work/sc/work/event.xml');

Creates a new C<SC::Event> from XML, which may be passed directly or can be
read from a file.    

=item new SC::Event(event_type => 'EARTHQUAKE', event_name => 'Northridge');

Creates a new C<SC::Event> with the given attributes.

=item $event->write_to_db

Writes the event to the database.  The event may already exist; in this case
the event is silently ignored.  The return value indicates

  0 for errors (C<$SC::errstr> will be set),
  1 for successful insert, or
  2 if the record already existed.
