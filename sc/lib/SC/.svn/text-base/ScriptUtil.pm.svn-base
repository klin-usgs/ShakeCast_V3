=head1 NAME

SC::ScriptUtil - a collection of utility routines used by the server scripts

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module contains utility routines that are used
by the server-to-server scripts in C</scripts/s>.
All documented methods are exported by default.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=over 4

=item C<read_xml_input>

  $xml = read_xml_input;

This routine reads a well-formed XML document from STDIN and returns it.
If the document begins with an XML declaration that is stripped out.
The resulting string may contain embedded newlines.

=item C<reply>

  reply( $status, $message )
  reply( $status, $message, $return_value )

This routine writes a standard ShakeCast XML status or response document to
STDOUT, along with the necessary HTTP headers.  The first version outputs
a C<shakecast_status> document.  The second version writes a
C<shakecast_response> document, with C<$return_value> as the body of the
response.  In this case the C<$return_value> is assumed to be valid XML
that does not require any further processing (for example, the result of
a query issued by a remote polling server).

The message is XML-escaped as needed.  The C<$status> value is assumed to be
a valid status value.
