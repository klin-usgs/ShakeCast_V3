# ShakeCast Script Utilities

A number of valuable Perl scripts are distributed with ShakeCast. This Appendix documents these utilities. For the most part, these scripts are internal to the system and normally users many need only a few of them, but users with complicated databases and needs may benefit at least an awareness of their functionality.

**NAME**

facility\_feature\_shaking.pl – Ground Shaking Estimation Tool for Facilities with Complex Geometry

**SYNOPSIS**

facility\_feature\_shaking.pl <operation> [option ...]

**DESCRIPTION**

The **facility\_feature\_shaking.pl** utility is used to generate ground-shaking estimates for facilities with complex geometry.  It reads one event id and one version from the command line.  Output of the script is saved in facility\_feature\_shaking.xml under the directory of the specified event.

The default grid processing routine of ShakeCast handles facilities with either point or rectangle shapes.  Recognized complex shapes include circle, polyline, and polygon.  The shaking information is considered as secondary and cannot be used as notification thresholds.

This script is usually invoked by ShakeCast as part of the automated process.  It can be run manually or by the system workers through dispatcher tasks.

**OPERATIONS**

**event**

Specify ID of the event to process.

**version**

Specify Version of the event to process.

**OPTIONS**

**--verbose**

Display more detailed information about the progress of the analysis.  This option may be repeated to increase detail further.

**--help**

Print a synopsis of program usage and invocation options

**NAME**

facility\_fragility\_stat.pl – Probabilistic Fragility Estimation Tool for Facilities with Probability Fragility Curves

**SYNOPSIS**

facility\_fragility\_stat.pl <operation> [option ...]

**DESCRIPTION**

The **facility\_fragility\_stat.pl** utility is used to evaluate both CDF and distribution of likelihood of damage states for each identified components of the facility. It reads one event id and one version from the command line.  Full fragility curve interpretation is one of the most time consuming processes of ShakeCast.  The utility saves results of the analysis in both binary form "frag\_prob.hash" and in text form "frag\_prob.json".  The binary data is a fully structured data storage that captures a snapshot of the final data output that can be used by subsequent processes without repeating the same computation.  The text-based JSON output is designed for presentations through the web interface.

The shaking information is considered as secondary and cannot be used as notification thresholds.  The probability fragility tool provides detailed evaluations to complement the basic fragility and notification processes.

This script is usually invoked by ShakeCast as part of the automated process.  It can be run manually or by the system workers through dispatcher tasks.

**OPERATIONS**

**event**

Specify ID of the event to process.

**version**

Specify Version of the event to process.

**OPTIONS**

**--verbose**

Display more detailed information about the progress of the analysis.  This option may be repeated to increase detail further.

**--help**

Print a synopsis of program usage and invocation options

**NAME**

facility\_regulatory\_level.pl – Tool for Evaluating Exceedance of Regulatory Levels for Nuclear Power Plants

**SYNOPSIS**

facility\_regulatory\_level.pl <operation> [option ...]

**DESCRIPTION**

The **facility\_regulatory\_level.pl** utility is used to evaluate exceedance of regulatory levels for nuclear power plants.  Regulatory levels include SL1/OBE, SL2/SSE, and Reg. 1.166 Appendix A. It reads one event id and one version from the command line.  Results of evaluations are saved in the output file "facility\_regulatory\_level.xml" to be used in preparing the PDF reports and to be displayed through the web interface.

The shaking information is considered as secondary and cannot be used as notification thresholds.  Although the script is created for the nuclear industry as part of the project requirement, it can be modified to provide user-specific criteria as a rule-based analysis tool.  The regulatory level tool provides detailed evaluations to complement the basic fragility and notification processes.

This script is usually invoked by ShakeCast as part of the automated process.  It can be run manually or by the system workers through dispatcher tasks.

**OPERATIONS**

**event**

Specify ID of the event to process.

**version**

Specify Version of the event to process.

**OPTIONS**

**--verbose**

Display more detailed information about the progress of the analysis.  This option may be repeated to increase detail further.

**--help**

**NAME**

gs\_json.pl – USGS Earthquake JSON Feed Parser Tool

**SYNOPSIS**

gs\_json.pl

**DESCRIPTION**

The **gs\_json.pl** utility is used to parse the USGS earthquake JSON feed and selected products from the web server.  Currently accepted earthquake product types include ShakeMap, DYFI?, PAGER, Earthquake Location Map, Historical Moment Tensor Map, Historical Seismicity Map, Tectonic Summary, Origin.  The parser follows the JSON feed of individual earthquake products to download the selected products for use by the local ShakeCast system.  Origin, ShakeMap, DYFI? and PAGER will invoke a Dispatcher task to handle the downloaded products.

This script is usually invoked by ShakeCast as part of the automated process.  It can be run manually or queued to be handled by the system workers.

**NAME**

heartbeat.pl - ShakeCast Heartbeat Generator

**SYNOPSIS**

heartbeat.pl

**DESCRIPTION**

The **heartbeat.pl** utility is used to generate a ShakeCast event XML with event type as "HEARTBEAT."  The output is injected into the ShakeCast system via **sm\_inject.pl** and a copy stored in the ShakeMap data directory.  This will trigger an event notification to users whom are subscribed to receiving heartbeat events.

The script reads no options from the command line.  To create a customized heartbeat event, edit the script located inside the ShakeCast bin directory.

**NAME**

logrotate.pl - ShakeCast Log File Rotation Tool

**SYNOPSIS**

logrotate.pl [-conf config file]

**DESCRIPTION**

The **logrotate.pl** utility is used to generate rotating backup files of ShakeCast log files (sc.log, sc\_access.log, and sc\_error.log).  Configurable parameters include rotate-time, max\_size, keep-files, compress, and status-file.  The administrator can schedule a routine run of this script for maintenance of ShakeCast log files.

The script reads one optional configuration file from the command line.  The default configuration file is "sc.conf".

**rotate-time**

Specify the time windows for keeping log entries.

**max\_size**

Specify the size limit of log files.

**keep-files**

The **logstats.pl** utility is used to process ShakeCast log files (sc.log, sc\_access.log, and sc\_error.log) specified in the system configuration file and generate a set of image files in both histogram and pie charts.  The daily activity chart is the default chart displayed in the default page of the Administration Web Interface.  The administrator can schedule a routine run of this script to generate new statistics charts.

The script reads one optional configuration file from the command line.  The default configuration file is "sc.conf".

**OPTIONS**

**--conf**

Specify the filename of a custom configuration file to read process parameters for logstats.pl.

**NAME**

manage\_event.pl - ShakeCast Event Management Tool

**SYNOPSIS**

manage\_event.pl [mode] [option ...] event\_id [event\_id2 ...]

**DESCRIPTION**

The **manage\_event.pl** utility is used to re-alert, or delete processed ShakeMap events in the ShakeCast database.  It reads one or more event ids from the command line.  Mode is one of –resend or --delete.  manage\_event.pl will return an error message if you do not specify a mode.

**--resend**

Reprocess notifications for the ShakeMaps and resend notifications to users who are on the recipient list.

**--delete**

Delete existing events.  All information for the processed ShakeMaps will be removed from the ShakeCast database but not downloaded products in the file system.

**NAME**

manage\_facility.pl - ShakeCast Facility Management Tool

**SYNOPSIS**

manage\_facility.pl [mode] [option ...] file.csv [file2.csv ...]

**DESCRIPTION**

The **manage\_facility.pl** utility is used to insert, update, or delete facility data in the ShakeCast database. It reads data from one or more CSV format files.  One or more files must be given on the command line. Multiple files can have different formats.  Mode is one of --insert, --replace, --delete, --update, or --skip.  manage\_facility.pl will operate in replace mode if you do not specify a mode.

**--insert**

New facility records are inserted.  It is an error for the facility to already exist; if it does the input record is skipped.

**--replace**

New records are inserted.  If there is an existing facility it is first deleted, along with any associated attributes and fragility levels.  All required facility fields must be supplied.

**--delete**

Delete existing facilities.  All required facility fields must be supplied.

**--skip**

New facility records are inserted.  Records for existing facilities are skipped without generating an error.  The summary report will indicate how many records were skipped.

**--update**

Update existing facilities.  If the facility does not already exist an error is issued and the record is skipped.

In this mode the only required fields are EXTERNAL\_FACILITY\_ID and FACILITY\_TYPE.  Any group values are simply added to the existing set of attributes for the facility, unless the new value matches an existing value, in which case the group value is skipped.  For metrics, any metric that appears in the input will be completely replaced.

**OPTIONS**

**--verbose**

Display more detailed information about the progress of the import.  This option may be repeated to increase detail further.

**--help**

Print a synopsis of program usage and invocation options

**--limit=**** n**

Terminate the import after **n** errors in input records.  Set to 0 to allow an unlimited number of errors.

This limit only applies to errors encountered when processing a data record from the input file.  More serious errors, such as omitting a required field, will always cause the entire input file to be skipped.

**--quote=**** x**

Use _x_ as the quote character in the input file. The default quote character is a quote (").  This character is also used as the escape character within a quoted string.

**--separator=**** x**

Use _x_ as the field separator character in the input file.  The default separator character is a comma (,).

**FILE FORMAT**

**manage\_facility.pl** reads from one or more CSV-formatted files.  By default fields are separated by commas and field values that include commas are protected by enclosing them in quotes, but these defaults can be modified; see the **--quote** and **--separator** options below.

The first record in the input file must contain column headers.  These headers tell manage\_facility.pl how to interpret the rest of the records.  Each header field must specify a facility field, a facility metric field, or a group field.  The header fields are case-insensitive; facility\_name and FACILITY\_NAME are equivalent.  Fields can appear in any order.

**Facility Fields**

The following facility names are recognized.  These fields correspond to tables and columns in the ShakeCast database.  Please refer to the ShakeCast Database Description for a more detailed description of the structure of the ShakeCast Database.

**external\_facility\_id (Text(32), required always)**

This field identifies the facility.  It must be unique for a facility type but the same external\_facility\_id may be used for different types of facilities.

**facility\_type (Text(10), required always)**

This field identifies the type of facility.  It must match one of the types in the facility\_type table. Currently defined types are: BRIDGE, CAMPUS, CITY, COUNTY, DAM, DISTRICT, ENGINEERED, INDUSTRIAL, MULTIFAM, ROAD, SINGLEFAM, STRUCTURE, TANK, TUNNEL, UNKNOWN, and HAZUS building types.  Refer the HAZUS Damage Level document for the 128 HAZUS building types and code era.

**facility\_name (Text(128), required for insert/replace)**

The value of this field is what the user sees.

**short\_name (Text(10), optional)**

The value of this field is used by ShakeCast when a shorter version of the name is needed due to space limitations in the output.

**description (Text(255), optional)**

You can use this field to include a short description of the facility.

**lat (Float, required for insert/replace)**

Specifies the latitude of the facility in degrees and fractional degrees.

**lon (Float, required for insert/replace)**

Specifies the longitude of the facility in degrees and fractional degrees.

**Fragility Fields**

Each field beginning with METRIC: is taken to be a facility fragility specifier. The format of a fragility specifier is:

**METRIC:** _metric-name_ **:** _damage-level_

where _metric-name_ is a valid Shakemap metric (MMI, PGV, PGA, PSA03, PSA10, or PSA30) and _damage-level_ is a valid damage level (GREEN, YELLOW, ORANGE, or RED).  Examples of Facility Fragility column labels are METRIC:MMI:RED and metric:pga:yellow.

The metric-name values are defined by the ShakeMap system, and are generally not changed.  The above values are current as of summer 2007.  The damage-level values shown above are the default values shipped with ShakeCast.  These values are defined in your local ShakeCast database, and you may use the administration web interface to change those values and the color-names that refer to them.

**Attribute Fields**

A facility can have attributes associated with it.  These attributes can be used to group and filter facilities.

Each field beginning with ATTR: is taken to be a facility attribute specifier.  The format of a facility attribute specifier is:

**ATTR:** _attribute-name_ **:** _attribute-value_

where _attribute-name_ is a string not more than 20 characters in length.

Examples of Facility Attribute column labels are ATTR:COUNTY and ATTR:Construction.  Attribute values can be any string up to 30 characters long.

**EXAMPLES**

**Example 1 -- Point Facilities**

Assume we have a file named _ca\_cities.csv_ containing California cities that we want to load into the ShakeCast database.  The file is in CSV format and includes the name of each city and the latitude/longitude of its city center or city hall.  Records in the file are of the form

  Rancho Cucamonga,34.1233,-117.5794

  Pasadena,34.1561,-118.1318

The file is missing two required fields, external\_facility\_id and facility\_type.  Since the city name is unique we can add a new column that is a copy of the name column and use that as the external\_facility\_id.  Another column containing the value CITY for each row is added for the facility\_type.  You can either make these changes using a spreadsheet program or with a simple script written in a text processing language like Perl.

After making these modifications the records look like

  CITY,Rancho Cucamonga,Rancho Cucamonga,34.1233,-117.5794

  CITY,Pasadena,Pasadena,34.1561,-118.1318

The input file also needs a header record; after adding one the input file looks like

  FACILITY\_TYPE,EXTERNAL\_FACILITY\_ID,FACILITY\_NAME,LAT,LON

  CITY,Rancho Cucamonga,Rancho Cucamonga,34.1233,-117.5794

  CITY,Pasadena,Pasadena,34.1561,-118.1318

   ...

The facilities in this file can now be loaded into ShakeCast using the command

  manage\_facility.pl ca\_cities.csv

**Example 2 -- Fragility Parameters**

It is easy to load fragility parameters for your facilities using **manage\_facility.pl**.  Building on the previous example, assume a simple model where Instrumental Intensity (MMI) above 7 corresponds to high-level alert (RED), MMI between 5 and 7 corresponds to medium-level alert (YELLOW), and MMI below 5 corresponds to little a low-level (GREEN).  The lower threshold of each range (1, 5, 7) is appended to every record in the input file and the header record is changed to reflect the added fields:

  FACILITY\_TYPE,EXTERNAL\_FACILITY\_ID,FACILITY\_NAME,LAT,LON, \

        METRIC:MMI:GREEN,METRIC:MMI:YELLOW,METRIC:MMI:RED

  CITY,Rancho Cucamonga,Rancho Cucamonga,34.1233,-117.5794,1,5,7

  CITY,Pasadena,Pasadena,34.1561,-118.1318,1,5,7

   ...

Import this file as before.  New facility data will replace existing ones.

**Example 3 -- Multiple Attributes and Multiple Metrics**

You can include multiple attributes, multiple metrics, or multiple attributes and multiple metrics for each row of an import file.  For example,

  FACILITY\_TYPE,EXTERNAL\_FACILITY\_ID,ATTR:COUNTY, ATTR:SIZE,\

        METRIC:MMI:GREEN, METRIC:MMI:YELLOW, METRIC:MMI:RED

  CITY,Rancho Cucamonga,San Bernardino,Small,1,2,6

  CITY,Pasadena,os Angeles,Medium,1,2,6

This file would be loaded using the command

  manage\_facility.pl --update city\_county.csv

The above example updates the existing city locations to associate them with a county attribute and a size attribute, and defines the green, yellow, and red alert level shaking thresholds.

**NAME**

manage\_group.pl - ShakeCast Group Management Tool

**SYNOPSIS**

manage\_group.pl [mode] [option ...] [profile.conf] [lat,lon …]

**DESCRIPTION**

The **manage\_group.pl** utility is used to insert, update, or delete groups in the ShakeCast database and to associate facilities within the profile boundaries with the geometric profile.  It reads data from a group configuration file or lat/lon pairs of a polygon from the command line.  Mode is one of --insert, --delete, --update, or --poly.  manage\_group.pl will operate in replace mode if you do not specify a mode.

**--insert**

New groups are inserted.  It is an error if the group already exists; if it does the input record is skipped.

**--delete**

Delete existing groups.  All required group fields must be supplied.

**--poly**

Read polygon data from the command line and output facility data within the polygon boundaries.

**OPTIONS**

**--conf**

Specify the optional profile configuration file.

**--verbose**

Display more detailed information about the progress of the import.  This option may be repeated to increase detail further.

**--help**

Print a synopsis of program usage and invocation options

**FILE FORMAT**

**manage\_group.pl** reads data from a file in Apache config format.  Lines begin with '#' and empty lines will be ignored.  Spaces at the beginning and the end of a line will also be ignored as well as tabulators.  If you need spaces at the end or the beginning of a value you can use apostrophe **"**. An option line starts with its name followed by a value. An '=' sign is optional.  Some possible examples:

        user    max

        user  = max

        user            max

If there is more than one statement with the same name, it will create an array instead of a scalar.

Each group is defined as a **block** of options.  A **block** looks much like a block in the apache config format. It starts with < **blockname** > and ends with </ **blockname** >. An example:

 <CI>

        POLY         35.8000 -116.4000        \

                34.0815 -114.4717        \

                32.0000 -114.3333        \

                    PRODUCT\_TYPE                GRID\_XML

                EVENT\_TYPE                ALL

        </NOTIFICATION>

 </CI>

**Group Tag Names**

The following profile tag names are recognized.  These fields correspond to tables and columns in the ShakeCast database.  Please refer to the ShakeCast Database Description for a more detailed description of the structure of the ShakeCast Database.

**poly (float pairs, required always)**

This field identifies the boundaries of the profile geometry.  It must contain at least three anchor points in order to define a polygon.  The total number of anchor points should limit to less than 100, otherwise the administration interface may not be able to display the entire polygon during editing.  The manage\_profile.pl will however process the polygon definition.

**notification (Text(32), optional)**

One notification block represents one notification request associated with the profile and applies to all facilities within the profile polygon.  Multiple notification blocks for a profile are permitted.

**Notification Tag Names**

Each notification block defines one notification request.  Tag names are corresponding to the field names of the table "profile\_notification\_request."  Required tags for a notification block include NOTIFICATION\_TYPE, DELIVERY\_METHOD, and EVENT\_TYPE.  Valid notification types are CAN\_EVENT, NEW\_EVENT, UPD\_EVENT, SHAKING, NEW\_PROD, and DAMAGE.

**can\_event**

This notification request is triggered when an event is cancelled by the seismic network region in which the event was located and the ShakeMap removed from the USGS web site.  Require EVENT\_TYPE and DELIVERY\_METHOD tags.

**new\_event**

This notification request is triggered when an event is located by a seismic network region and a ShakeMap becomes available on the USGS web site.  Require EVENT\_TYPE and DELIVERY\_METHOD tags.

**upd\_event**

This notification request is triggered when the source parameters of an event is updated with a new version by the seismic network.  New versions of ShakeMaps for the event may or may not coincide with an updated event.  Require EVENT\_TYPE and DELIVERY\_METHOD tags.

**new\_prod**

This notification request is triggered when a specified ShakeMap product of an event is available on the USGS web site.  Require EVENT\_TYPE,DELIVERY\_METHOD, and PRODUCT tags.

**shaking**

This notification request is triggered when the ground shaking parameter at the location of the facility exceeds the preset value.  Require EVENT\_TYPE,DELIVERY\_METHOD, METRIC, and LIMIT\_VALUE tags.

**damage**

This notification request is triggered when the ground shaking parameter at the location of the facility falls between the high and low values of facility fragility settings.  Require EVENT\_TYPE,DELIVERY\_METHOD, and DAMAGE\_LEVEL tags.

**NAME**

map\_tile.pl – ShakeCast Image Tile Generation Tool

**SYNOPSIS**

map\_tile.pl -type map\_type [option ...]

**DESCRIPTION**

The **map\_tile.pl** utility is used to generate images tiles to be used by the mapping engine of the web interface.  Initially, the generated map tiles are used by the Google Maps API and can also be used by other mapping engines, such as the OpenLayers or OpenStreetMap.  It reads one map\_type from the command line.  The map type includes earthquake, facility, and station.

Earthquake tiles are dynamically updated as soon as a new event is processed by the ShakeCast system.   Both facility and station tiles are considered semi-static.  Update of these tiles can be done manually or by creating a cron job in the database to schedule generation of tiles.

**OPTIONS**

**--map\_type**

Specify type of map tile to process.  The type must be either "event\_tile", "facility\_tile", or "station\_tile".

**--min\_zoom**

Specify the minimum zoom level to process. The zoom level must be between 1 and 18.

**--max\_zoom**

Specify the maximum zoom level to process. The zoom level must be between 1 and 18.

**--rebuild**

Delete all existing map tiles of the specified type before generating new map tiles.

**--id**

Create map tiles only for facility of the selected ID.

**--verbose**

Display more detailed information about the progress of the import.  This option may be repeated to increase detail further.

**--help**

**NAME**

sc\_pdf.pl – ShakeCast PDF Report Generation Tool

**SYNOPSIS**

sc\_pdf.pl -event event\_id –version [option ...]

**DESCRIPTION**

The **sc\_pdf.pl** utility is used to generate PDF reports for the selected earthquake.  It reads one event id and one version from the command line.  It will loop through all defined PDF templates in the PDF template directory.  If a PDF report is successfully created, it will be registered as a local product and saved into the earthquake-specific data directory.

This script is usually invoked by ShakeCast as part of the automated process.  It can be run manually or queued to be handled by the system workers.

**OPTIONS**

**--event**

Specify ID of the event to process.

**--version**

**NAME**

scfeed\_local.pl – ShakeMap Grid/Product Injection Tool

**SYNOPSIS**

scfeed\_local.pl [-event event\_id] [option ...]

**DESCRIPTION**

The **scfeed\_local.pl** utility is used to process downloaded ShakeMap products located in the ShakeCast data directory.  It reads one event id from the command line and creates XML messages before feeding them to ShakeCast.  The injection process triggers the ShakeCast process in the same manner as for a real earthquake with respect to facility damage assessment and user notifications.

The name of an unprocessed ShakeMap must match the name of the event ID.  ShakeMaps can be downloaded via the USGS ShakeMap link from the ShakeCast Administration Panel or manually from other sources.  It will be renamed with the version number appended to the end of the directory name after **scfeed\_local.pl** processed the ShakeMap.  Outputs of ShakeCast XML files will also be stored in the same directory.

The script will quit gracefully if the ShakeMap has been processed earlier by the ShakeCast system and as a result no notifications will be delivered.  To reprocess a ShakeMap that already exists in the ShakeCast system, the administrator will need to either convert the ShakeMap into a test event or delete the event first.  In addition to the Administration Interface, an administrator can use the **tester.pl** utility to convert a ShakeMap to a test event and the **manage\_event.pl** utility to delete a ShakeMap.  The ShakeCast data directory for the deleted ShakeMap also needs to be removed from the file system before starting the reprocess procedure described earlier.

**OPTIONS**

**--event**

Specify ID of the event to process.

**--scenario**

Treat the ShakeMap as a scenario.

**--force\_run**

Force ShakeCast to process the ShakeMap for events that do not meet the process criteria.

**--verbose**

**NAME**

shake\_fetch.pl – ShakeMap Retrieval/Injection Tool

**SYNOPSIS**

shake\_fetch.pl -network net\_id -event event\_id [option ...]

**DESCRIPTION**

The **shake\_fetch.pl** utility is used to download and process ShakeMap located on the USGS web site.  It reads one network id and one event id from the command line.  ShakeMap products on the USGS web site are first downloaded before invoking the scfeed\_local process to inject the ShakeMap into ShakeCast.  The injection process is exactly the same as the scfeed\_local script.

**OPTIONS**

**--network**

Specify ID of the network to process.

**--event**

Specify ID of the event to process.

**--scenario**

Treat the ShakeMap as a scenario.

**--force\_run**

Force ShakeCast to process the ShakeMap for events that do not meet the process criteria.

**NAME**

template.pl – ShakeCast General Templating Tool

**SYNOPSIS**

template.pl [option ...] –event event\_id –template template

**DESCRIPTION**
